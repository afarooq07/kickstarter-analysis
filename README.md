### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	- May is the most successful month across all years for launching campaigns, with June as the second succesful month
	- December has the lowest success rate with only 50% campaigns hitting their goals, so not a good month to launch a fund raising campaign

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
	- Compaigns with more than 70% success rate had a goal of $5000 or less, with the mean goal of succesful compaigns at $5049. This implies that campaigns with a goal of $5000 or less have a greater chance of succeeding.

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**
	-The dataset does not indicate the type of fund raising/marketing strategy implied to draw attention. For example, donation based on reward based etc
	-There aren't any details regarding initial captial used to setup the fundraiser 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
