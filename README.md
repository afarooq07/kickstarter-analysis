# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The scope of the project is to:
- Analyze crowdfunding campaigns in the past years (2009-2017) in theater category and determine if there are any specific factors that make campaigns successful
- Evaluate how these past campaigns performed compared to Louise's campaign for her play *Fever*.

### Purpose

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	- May is the most successful month across all years for launching campaigns, with June as the second succesful month
	- December has the lowest success rate with only 50% campaigns hitting their goals, so not a good month to launch a fund raising campaign

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
	- Compaigns with more than 70% success rate had a goal of $5000 or less, with the mean goal of succesful compaigns at $5049. This implies that campaigns with a goal of $5000 or less have a greater chance of succeeding.

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**
	- The dataset does not indicate the type of fund raising/marketing strategy employed to draw attention and raise funds. For example, donation based or rewards based etc. 
	- There aren't any details regarding initial captial used to setup the fundraiser 
	- There is no information on cities/regions where the fundraiser was hosted, so it is impossible to guage if there is a correlation between geography and outcomes
	- The spreadsheet does not include economic conditions during the years which could have been a contributing factor in making a compaign successful

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
Depending on what we are trying to evaluate, we can visual data in multiple ways such as stacked chart of outcomes by categories. This will help us visual how different categories performanced. We can create year filter to further drill down to years.
