# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The scope of the project is to:
- Analyze crowdfunding campaigns in the past years (2009-2017) in theater category and determine if there are any specific factors that make campaigns successful
- Evaluate how these past campaigns performed compared to Louise's campaign for her play *Fever*.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
	- May is the most successful month across all years for launching campaigns 
	- December has the lowest success rate with only 50% campaigns hitting their goals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
